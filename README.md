# Hackathon-HabitCreator
The HabitCreator is a web appplication designed to help implement and maintain healthy habits. It incorporates an interactive grow 
environment to engage the user with their progress. The current program tackles the issue of establishing a healthy sleep schedule;
however, our future plans for this project include individual goals that can be customized to suit the habits that the user wants to
establish.
